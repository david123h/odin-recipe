    <h4>How To Perfectly Saute Mushrooms:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean and Slice. Wipe your mushrooms off with a damp towel <br>
            or quickly rinse and dry well. You don’t want excess water on <br>
            them because it will take longer to cook and contribute to soggy <br>
            mushrooms. Slice them into thick slices – mushrooms shrink a ton <br>
            when cooked and thicker slices cook the best.</li>
        <br><li>Heat Oil/Butter. In a large saute pan, add your oil and butter and <br>
            turn the heat up to medium high. You want it to get hot before you add <br>
            your mushrooms. The reason that the oil/butter combination is so important <br>
             is because the oil allows for cooking at a higher heat allowing the moisture <br>
              to evaporate quickly. This is the key to caramelization.</li>
        <br><li>Cook. Add mushrooms to your pan and make sure you allow some space between <br>
            the mushrooms. If you overcrowd them, the moisture will steam the mushrooms <br>
            instead of searing and make them soggy. Cook for 4-5 minutes before touching <br>
            them. Then give them a good stir so that the other side cooks and gets nice and brown.</li>
        <br><li>Finish. You will know your mushrooms are done when all of the liquid has evaporated. <br>
             Your mushrooms should look golden brown and caramelized.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>How to Make Creamy Mushroom Pasta:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta according to package directions and drain</li>
        <br><li>Saute mushrooms using the above method. Once they are done, turn the <br>
            heat down to medium and add garlic and 1/3 of the broth to deglaze the pan. <br>
             Cook for another minute.</li>
        <br><li>Add milk and salt; stir to combine. Add the cooked pasta and the  remaining broth.</li>
        <br><li>If you are adding spinach, cut using a chiffonade method. To do this, <br>
             stack the spinach leaves on top of each other and roll them into a ‘burrito’. <br>
              Using a sharp knife, make very small cuts creating strips. Add to pan.</li>
        <br><li>Stir in Parmesan and cream cheese; cook another 2-3 minutes or until heated <br>
             through and the cheese is melted. Serve warm and enjoy!
